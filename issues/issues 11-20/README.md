Here are examples for the next 10 Git/GitHub problems (11-20):

---

### **11. Not Updating Submodules**  
**Problem:** Submodules (linked repositories) aren’t updated, causing missing or outdated dependencies.  
**Example:**  
You cloned a repository with submodules:  
```bash
git clone --recursive <repo-url>
```
Later, you pull updates but forget to update submodules:  
```bash
git pull
# Submodules remain outdated.
```
**Solution:**  
Always update submodules after pulling:  
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

---

### **12. Unclear Commit Messages**  
**Problem:** Vague commit messages make it hard to understand changes.  
**Example:**  
```bash
git commit -m "Fix stuff"
```
Months later, no one knows what "stuff" means.  
**Solution:**  
Write descriptive messages:  
```bash
git commit -m "Fix typo in README.md and update installation steps"
```

---

### **13. Working on the Wrong Branch**  
**Problem:** You accidentally make changes on the wrong branch.  
**Example:**  
You’re on the `main` branch but wanted to work on `feature-branch`:  
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```
**Solution:**  
Move your changes to the correct branch:  
```bash
git stash
git checkout feature-branch
git stash apply
```

---

### **14. Confusion Around Rebasing vs Merging**  
**Problem:** Rebasing changes shared branch history and causes conflicts.  
**Example:**  
You rebase instead of merging:  
```bash
git rebase main
```
This rewrites history and creates conflicts for others.  
**Solution:**  
Use merging for shared branches:  
```bash
git merge main
```

---

### **15. Forgotten or Lost Stashed Changes**  
**Problem:** Stashed changes are forgotten or overwritten.  
**Example:**  
You stash work:  
```bash
git stash
```
Later, you accidentally overwrite it with a new stash:  
```bash
git stash save "new work"
```
The old stash is lost.  
**Solution:**  
List stashes and apply them selectively:  
```bash
git stash list
git stash apply stash@{0}
```

---

### **16. Problems with Cloning or Forking**  
**Problem:** Incorrect URLs or lack of permissions prevent cloning or forking.  
**Example:**  
You try to clone a private repository without access:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/private/repo.git
# Error: Permission denied.
```
**Solution:**  
Ensure you have the correct URL and access. For private repos, use SSH:  
```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
```

---

### **17. Handling Binary Files**  
**Problem:** Git tracks binary files poorly, causing bloated repositories and merge conflicts.  
**Example:**  
You add a 50MB video:  
```bash
git add video.mp4
```
Later, merging changes causes conflicts because Git can’t merge binary files.  
**Solution:**  
Use Git LFS for binary files:  
```bash
git lfs track "*.mp4"
git add .gitattributes
git add video.mp4
```

---

### **18. Repository Permissions**  
**Problem:** Team members can’t access or change parts of a project due to incorrect permissions.  
**Example:**  
A contributor tries to push changes:  
```bash
git push origin feature-branch
# Error: Permission denied.
```
**Solution:**  
On GitHub, update permissions in the repository settings. For example, give "Write" access to contributors.

---

### **19. Long-Lived Feature Branches**  
**Problem:** Working on a branch for too long makes merging harder due to diverging changes.  
**Example:**  
You work on `feature-branch` for months without merging updates from `main`.  
When you finally merge:  
```bash
git merge main
```
You face numerous conflicts.  
**Solution:**  
Regularly rebase or merge `main` into your branch:  
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
```

---

### **20. GitHub Actions Misconfigurations**  
**Problem:** Errors in automation workflows cause failed builds or deployments.  
**Example:**  
Your GitHub Actions workflow fails because of a typo in `main.yml`:  
```yaml
runs-on: unbuntu-latest  # Typo: should be "ubuntu-latest"
```
**Solution:**  
Test workflows locally using tools like [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) before pushing them to GitHub.
