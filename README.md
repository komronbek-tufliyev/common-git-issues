## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. **Issue: Merge Conflicts**

**Problem:** When merging branches, you may encounter merge conflicts that need to be manually resolved.

**Solution:**  
- Run `git status` to see the conflicted files.
- Open the conflicted files and look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
- Edit the file to keep the correct code and remove the conflict markers.
- Stage the changes with `git add <file>`.
- Complete the merge with `git merge --continue`.

### 2. **Issue: Forgot to Commit Changes**

**Problem:** You forgot to commit changes before switching branches or pulling updates.

**Solution:**  
- Run `git stash` to temporarily save changes.
- Switch branches or pull the latest updates.
- Use `git stash pop` to reapply the saved changes.

### 3. **Issue: Detached HEAD State**

**Problem:** You've checked out a specific commit, and you're in a detached HEAD state.

**Solution:**  
- Create a new branch from the detached HEAD using `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`.
- Alternatively, you can switch back to an existing branch with `git checkout <branch-name>`.

### 4. **Issue: Undoing the Last Commit**

**Problem:** You want to undo the last commit but keep the changes locally.

**Solution:**  
- Run `git reset --soft HEAD~1` to undo the commit and keep the changes in your working directory.
